# Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return *the square root of* `x` *rounded down to the nearest integer*. The returned integer should be __non-negative__ as well.

You __must not__ use any built-in exponent function or operator.



**Example 1:** \
__Input:__ ```x = 4``` \
__Output:__ ```2``` \
__Explanation:__ ```The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2```

**Example 2:** \
__Input:__ ```x = 8```\
__Output:__ ```2``` \
__Explanation:__ ```The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned```



**Constraints:**
* ```0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1```
